* vmacs.d

My emacs config begun after returning from several years wandering in the vim
wilderness. I doubt you want to use this as is, I'm still working it out and it
contains a lot of old stuff from my old setup that needs to be thoroughly
revisited and refactored. Feel free to nick as much lisp from it as you like
though.

Requires ~>=~ Emacs 26.

After first launch, invoke: ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~
